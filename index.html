        <p>Hello my name is Jakob Lumpkin and I'm 24 years old. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas.
            I joined the Air Force start out of High School and never been to college. I was in there for 
            about 4 years. I didn't take any college classes while serving. After getting out the military, I
            became a plumber apprentice for about a month then gave that up. Then decided to get my 
            CDL Trucking license and while doing that I was trying to learn to code in my free time. After
            that I decided to attend coding bootcamp to increase my chances of landing a job.
            Now I'm here going along with you all. My short term goal is to land a job and 
            improve my skills.
        </p>
